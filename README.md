# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

In this project I was tasked with building an enterprise team profile generator for a hypothetical work group. Users connected to the app via the terminal are prompted to first enter the information of the manager, then choose an arbitrary number of engineers and interns, filling the information out for each in turn. After the user chooses to discontinue adding new staff the app will immediately generate an HTML for a webpage presenting the information gathered earlier. The email and github information provided for various employees will link appropriately to a mail service or the github page.

The main problems I faced with this project were the use of back-end functions involving NodeJS, classes and constructors and the testing module, Jest. I had to initializing a package from NPM, as well as link multiple javascript files together for full functionality. Using Jest I had to ensure the app's functionality by performing a series of tests for each of my class files.

Please follow the link below for a walkthrough of the program functionality that I performed with Screencastify:
